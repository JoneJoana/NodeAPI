# Node API 

## My first project with Node.js and Typescript

Demo project to learn node basics, get familiar with API Development and play with new design patterns. 
I've tried to follow the Single Responsability Principle creating different components (http controllers, express routes, model, repository, etc).

- Node.js
- NPM
- Express.js
- Typescript
- API Design (GET, POST, PUT, PATC, DELETE)
- Design patterns:
    - Repository
    - Singleton
 

### Next Steps:
 - API error management
 - API contract validation
 - Implementation of use cases
 - ...
